Description: Impute the survival times for censored observations based on their conditional survival distributions derived from the Kaplan-Meier estimator. 'CondiS' can replace the censored observations with the best approximations from the statistical model, allowing for direct application of machine learning-based methods. When covariates are available, 'CondiS' is extended by incorporating the covariate information through machine learning-based regression modeling ('CondiS_X'), which can further improve the imputed survival time.
